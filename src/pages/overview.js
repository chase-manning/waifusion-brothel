              In order to give Waifus an explicit rarity before they get WET
              they have a variety of traits with different percentage occurrence
              rates, for example: aliens are much rarer than humans. All of the
              traits listed on this site will have their rarity statistics
              released at the end of the sale but maybe these Waifus have more
              secrets for you to find, Anon-kun. ;-)
            </div>

            <div className="waifu-card-header-text">Get WET</div>
            <div className="waifu-card-text waifu-about-text">
              Get your Waifus Wet. Waifu Enhancement Token or WET is a token
              that allows you to change the name of your Waifus leaving your
              mark on them FOREVER or until you sell it and someone changes
              their name again. Every name is unique and can only be used once.
              In this way, you may change the rarity of your Waifus forever, so
              choose wisely. You can obtain WET 3 ways. First, when you buy a
              Waifu directly from us, you will get enough WET to change the
              Waifuâ€™s name once for each NFT purchased. The second way is for
              every Waifu you possess, you will accumulate 10 WET per day. The
              final way is you may receive WET from someone else's wallet who
              has collected it from their own Waifus.
